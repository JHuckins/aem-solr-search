Since then we have expanded from our ancient Greek origins to become a worldwide geometry and topology provider. We now have offices in Boston, Los Angeles, Basel and Singapore. Since 545 BC, Geometrixx has cemented its role as an industry thought leader, initiating and leading an industry-wide initiative to define and implement the standard for accessing shape repositories. That standard is BH 90210 - The Shape Repository Protocol (SRP). SRP is designed to overcome the challenge of proprietary shape repositories, helping companies to dramatically reduce costs, while increasing the efficiency and accessibility of their existing shapes. Geometrixx is now helping to define industry standards as an expert group member of phase 2 of SRP, BH 90210 (The Sequel). Developed in 2007, BH 90210 is under the continued leadership of Geometrixx\u2019s co-founder Pythagoras of Samos, and in recent months has successfully completed the Public Review process. Pythagoras is also an active committee member of the working group drafting the Shape Management Interoperability Specification (SMIS), a new proposed standard submitted to compliment to SRP. At Geometrixx our management team includes people who have been in the geometry business from the very beginning. Really, they invented geometry. Our CTO Pythagoras of Samos leads our engineering team, while high level guidance is provided by our CEO Plato and our CMO Aristotle. Our board is chaired by Socrates of Athens. This history, prestige and combined neural capacity has made Geometrixx the juggernaut it is today. The secret to our continued success (beyond the apparent immortality of the management team) is the large amount of hands-on involvement in many aspects of the business by management. Our long term vision is to make geometry accessible, easy to use, and affordable for everyone. This goal informs every decision that we make here at Geometrixx.  Economic uncertainty, increasing competitive pressures and rising demands for quality services are among the reasons why we need to address the value and return on your shape investments\u2014as well as improve service management capabilities. While better management of your shape services may be a priority, you might not know where to start. Geometrixx can help you in understanding where to invest capital and resources and how to install the right mix of business-focused technology and processes that can support higher-value outcomes. As an employer we believe in empowering our employees, allowing them to use their own initiative find solutions to your geometric problems.  As a corporate citizen we are committed to ethical and environmentally responsible geometry. Our shapes have been awarded top marks from the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Shape Rating System and we continue to pursue research into new green shape technology. 1% of our global after-tax profit is re-invested in children's charities through our \"Trapezoids for Tots\" program. A straight line segment can be drawn joining any two points. Any straight line segment can be extended indefinitely in a straight line. Given any straight line segment, a circle can be drawn having the segment as radius and one endpoint as center. All right angles are congruent. If two lines are drawn which intersect a third in such a way that the sum of the inner angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the two lines inevitably must intersect each other on that side if extended far enough. This postulate is equivalent to what is known as the parallel postulate. Things that equal the same thing also equal one another. If equals are added to equals, then the wholes are equal. If equals are subtracted from equals, then the remainders are equal. Things that coincide with one another equal one another. The whole is greater than the part.","last_modified":"2010-11-11T15:34:00.00Z","title":"Company","description":"","url":"\/content\/geometrixx\/en\/company.html","sling_resource_type":"geometrixx\/components\/contentpage"},{"id":"\/content\/geometrixx\/en\/company\/news","body":" Geometrixx is proud to announce the availability of the Rhombus 3000!

This means that it has four equal sides and four equal angles (90 degree angles, or right angles). In classical times, the second power was described in terms of the area of a square, as in the above formula. This led to the use of the term square to mean raising to the second power. In spherical geometry, a square is a polygon whose edges are great circle arcs of equal distance, which meet at equal angles.

In general, various approaches to consulting can be thought of as lying somewhere along a continuum, with an 'expert' or prescriptive approach at one end, and a facilitative approach at the other. In the expert approach, the consultant takes the role of expert, and provides expert advice or assistance to the client, with, compared to the facilitative approach, less input from, and fewer collaborations with, the client(s).  With a facilitative approach, the consultant focuses less on specific or technical expert knowledge, and more on the process of consultation itself. Because of this focus on process, a facilitative approach is also often referred to as 'process consulting,' with Edgar Schein being considered the most well-known practitioner. The consulting firms listed above are closer toward the expert approach of this continuum.","last_modified":"2010-11-05T16:53:00.00Z","title":"Strategic Consulting","description":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed consetetur sadipscing elitr ...","url":"\/content\/geometrixx\/en\/services\/strategic.html","sling_resource_type":"geometrixx\/components\/contentpage"},{"id":"\/content\/geometrixx\/en\/services","body":" Geometrixx is committed to providing high-quality services for all your geometry related needs.

With our help Widgetixx Corporation has recently installed a whole range of shapes, including dodecahedrons, icosohedrons and even an innovative new rhombic triacontahedron. Through our consulting services Widgetixx was able to certify that all their shapes are ISO 90210 compliant and childproof. In their most recent initiative, the company migrated their global shape collection to the complex plane. This effort is, of course, a key element in Widgetixx's global rollout of their new \u201CI\u2019m so square\u201D campaign.
